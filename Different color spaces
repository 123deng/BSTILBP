Results of different color spaces, the size of block is same which is 3*3,  
the following result is the median of 1000 times.
In HSI (hue, saturation, intensity), the arithmetic mean and standard deviation of hue and saturation are computed as the feature,
all of the color space is computed combined with these four features.
